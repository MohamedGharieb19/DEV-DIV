                The Dev Div Project is for absolute beginners in the world of web development and those who have tried other resources without success. In reality, The Dev Div Project is for anyone who wants to work as a web developer, do freelancing work, build a startup, or just hack together a homepage for yourself. All the tools you need are here. You should consider yourself fairly competent with personal computers and open to using a non-Windows based Operating System.


                We’ve built an in-depth curriculum designed to take you 100% of the way to becoming a web developer. Many other resources out there teach you just the basics of programming. With The Dev Div Project you’ll create your own websites, games, and social media sites.

            <div id="d2" class="collapse" style="width: 600px;margin-left: 10px;">
                The goal of The Dev Div Project is to provide a complete path for students to go from zero programming knowledge to employed as web developers while working with other students and picking up the skills to become self sufficient along the way.

                We won't have any of this 'Learn it all in two days!' BS. You can't start from scratch and learn true web development in such a short period of time and you know it. It's highly unlikely that you'll be employable after a weekend workshop or a one-month part-time course.


                On the other hand, you don't necessarily need to put in 4 years getting a CS degree. 80% of what they cover won't be used during a typical web developer's early career and it's not necessary to get hired. So why not learn the 20% and learn the rest while you're getting paid on the job?
                
                
                We've essentially distilled down what you most need to learn to hit that employable level, but it's still a healthy dose of learning. Depending how fast you learn, it will take roughly 1000 hours of work to hit that sweet spot. If you're naturally more technical or come from a technical background, it may be a bit faster. If you're less technical or brand new to all this, it will take longer. Don't despair! When you think about it, that's pretty much the same learning curve you had to climb to learn anything worthwhile so far in life.

                The Full Stack Javascript path maintains our front-end momentum from Foundations by delving into Javascript. Once you've got a solid foundation here, you'll take a deeper look at front-end design with HTML and CSS before taking your JavaScript skills to the server-side with Express and MongoDB in NodeJS.


                Along the way in either path you’ll learn Git and deployment so you can build your own portfolio, collaborate with others, and see your work on the web. Finally, The Odin Project will provide you with opportunities to work with legacy codebases and open-source projects. We’ll also cover areas specifically intended to help when you’re looking for employment.
                
                
                As you may have noticed, there is considerable overlap between the two paths with the only difference between them being the choice of back-end technology. They both guide you through harnessing the power of React along with software development paradigms such as Object-Oriented Programming and Test-Driven Development. More importantly, both paths will equally allow you to develop your own skills as a fullstack web developer.

                The Dev Div Project is different from other online programs in that it pulls the best resources from around the web and compiles them to create a complete curriculum. In many other programs the material is formatted to meet their specific curriculum. This means that not all of the lessons are top-notch. The Dev Div Project sidesteps this downfall by pulling various free resources from around the web and compiles them in one place.

                Dev Div is a figure from Norse mythology, the allfather of the gods. He is portrayed as powerful and fickle (as they often are) but also wise and cunning. His search for knowledge is a thing of legends - he gave his eye for the wisdom of ages and hung from the world tree, pierced by his own spear, for nine days and nights to gain the knowledge of runes.


                Learning web development is not an easy task and the tools laid out here are merely the path; you must walk it yourself. Should you possess a thirst for knowledge and persistence of spirit akin to that storied in Odin's mythos, you will find success on your journey.

                We don't provide a certificate for course completion. Employers will be much more impressed with your amazing personal portfolio of projects, many of which you'll hopefully have built with inspiration from The Dev Div Project.
